Explain how to start the system:
System is started by navigating to the handin4/Node1 folder in the terminal
and entering the command 'go run Node1.go'.
System is self-sufficient hereafter and user needs only to observe logs.

Program can be stopped/exited after a few seconds with 'ctrl + c'. In these
few seconds, it shoudl have already been clear that all 3 nodes have entered
Critical Section several times.
